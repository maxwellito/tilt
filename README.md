*A twinery based game about our relationship with technology.*

It all started with the idea to build a fresh version of command line game. After many designs and lack of views, the repo took the dust for a while.
Until the release of Black Mirror's Bandersnatch on Netflix. A "choose your own adventure" experience where you pick the choice of a character that always ends badly. It was fascinating to see how the game gives an illusion of control to bring the viewer where the author wants. After reading a bit more about the making of this experience, the author used [Twinery](http://twinery.org/) to build the tree choice storyline game. This open source software serves one purpose but does it well (once you understand how to link passages..): build stories.
The game topic turned changed to my loose of trust about big tech companies, regarding privacy concerns, social impacts, right to repair, planned obsolescence. Don't get me wrong, all of these companies got good and bad points. But the motivation behind this game is trolling.

Sadly, I haven't been able to wrap up some groundbreaking examples in each domain.

**TD;DR**: This game is a failed attempt to warn the public to be aware of privacy rights, right to repair, and other practices from tech companies.
